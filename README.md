<h1>Free Weather App</h1><br/>
The first public open source app, targeted towards keeping an active coding skill with developers who want to keep active and improve on their coding skills.<br/>
This project will include API integration from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather Map API</a> and will allow for improvements in the behavior and responsiveness of the app.
<br/>Kudos to all who have contributed so far.
