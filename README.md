<h1>Free Weather App</h1><br/>
The first public open source app, targeted towards keeping an active coding skill with developers who want to keep active and improve on their coding skills.<br/>
This project will include API integration from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather Map API</a> and will allow for improvements in the behavior and responsiveness of the app.
<br/>Kudos to all who have contributed so far.

<p>Shout out to <a href="https://github.com/SarahMarie73">Sarah Marie</a> for creating the first branch.</p>
<p>Another shout out to <a href="https://github.com/jameydev"> JameyDev</a> for adding the first JavaScript.</p>
<p>A creative shout out to <a href="https://github.com/cyberz3r0"> Samuel Reid</a> for adding GeoLocation feature to the app.</p>

☁️So I had to finish up the JavaScript and call in the weather API from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather Map API</a>. I initially set the default location to my home town, but <a href="https://github.com/cyberz3r0"> Samuel Reid</a> added a Geolocation feature that fetches the user's current location and displays the current weather.

☁️There are still a lot of contributions to be made, from favicon for designers to more robust CSS and JavaScript features.
